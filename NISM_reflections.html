		<p>
		In my second module in Master of Cyber Security which is Network and Information Security Management, required to achieve development team projects (design document and executive summary), in addition, the useful formative activities such as practical & team activity and scanning exercise, which were challenging. The aims of the design document were to test the assigned website (customersrus.co.uk) to identify regulations, all potential vulnerabilities, and provide recommendations and mitigations; in the other hand, the aims of the executive summary were to apply practical scanning on the website to identify the vulnerabilities and provide recommendations, moreover, find out the difference from the results from the first assignment (design document).
		</p>
		<p>
		Reflecting on my prior experience, it was my first time to be one of the multinational team members in learning/study. The first meeting gave me a positive impression about the team members as they are collaborative, committed, and respect each other which are the basic characteristics for any successful activity. Early, we decided to rotate the role of the project leader which is enhanced my personal skills such as leadership and people management, especially during my turn as project leader. We faced challenges such as one of Group 3 members withdrawing from the course and the assigned website was not listed in the provided categories, we adopted an approach to solving the consequences which are internal group member discussion then discussing with the tutor for further support. Therefore, agreed to achieve the project with the remaining three members and agreed with the tutor to deal with the assigned website as an e-commerce category.
		</p>
		<p>
		During the development of the design document assignment, the team had a regular online meeting for planning, discussion, and review; the assignment was divided into three tasks governing bodies/regulations, potential threats, and recommendations/mitigations, the third part (Recommendations and Mitigations) has assigned to me. It was challenging to find out potential vulnerabilities without using penetration test tools, I felt confused that I did know how to go forward, then I started intensive research about e-Commerce and SugarCRM in general, my works provided benefits to the team where I have drawn their attention to the importance to the deal with the assigned website as a SugarCRM product because it has its special regulations, threats, and mitigations. In addition, for providing mitigations I also provided potential threats which added value and helped in the next task. I have developed my analysis skills and threat modeling to find out web app vulnerabilities, especially for e-commerce and content relationship management systems. I feel confident after completing the project, especially when we got the feedback.
		</p>
		<p>
		For the development of the executive summary assignment, we started with an online meeting to suggest tools to be used for scanning and everyone has assigned tools to perform a scan on the assigned website, tasks divided to summarize the work, summarize findings, discuss the vulnerabilities, and recommendations. The first task (summarize the work) has assigned to me and we shared the fourth task (recommendations). Using the tools for the first time was a challenge, in addition, to the possibility to block our IP address by the system. We overcome such as challenges by team discussions and I spent the three weeks Christmas holiday to teach myself using Kali Linux and using tools for scan and find out the web app vulnerabilities by conducting testing and solving Pen test Lab installed on a virtual machine, moreover, using VPN to avoid blocking my IP address. The practical scanning taught me how to find the vulnerabilities and suggest the mitigations, which will be beneficial in my future as a security specialist, moreover the power of Linux compared with the limitations of Window 10 in the pen test field. In teamwork activities during this course we discussed and shared information and results, it was profitable to me as some have a deeper understanding of threat modeling using STRIDE and DREAD, while others on regulations and standards. In addition, I learned how to manage my time and write minutes of meetings as it was the first time for me to do.

		Because of the war in Yemen, I faced many difficulties and challenges during this course, such as a total interruption of the Internet for a whole week, in addition to the weak infrastructure of the communications network. However, I try hard to balance my time between work, study, and family. With the bad consequence of the war, I feel mixed feelings of grief, anger, and despair, but this is what prompted me to move forward to develop myself and discover sources of strength.
		</p>
		<p>
		In the first collaborative discussion, the initial post showed that the healthcare industry is one of the highest targets, highlighted that the brute force and DOS attacked as the major threats, and provided methods to prevent such as these attacks.  I have discovered how easy to compromise vulnerabilities with basic tools and basic background that is broadened my knowledge about the security risks and threats that could be faced in our daily life. The feedback from peers added new mitigation perspectives which were not mentioned in the initial post, the most important one was education/training for the users and should be aware of the potential threats on the healthcare industry.  In the second collaborative discussion, the initial post mentioned the results of using command tools such as tracert and nslookup, moreover, the results of online tools such as whois, findip, and ICANN lookup. The feedback from peers drew up my attention to the use of the Linux operating system as it includes commands such as dig and whois. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Obviously, as a group we achieved successful tasks, we broadened our knowledge by discussing and sharing information. On the professional level, I gain a rich knowledge about real-world security breaches, threat modeling, and analysis models, the importance of regulations such as (GDPR-HIPAA-PCI), network investigation, and providing recommendations and mitigations. On a personal level, I have improved skills such as time management and leadership. However, presentation skill is important to showing up my ideas to others and delivering information in a simple and easy way, which I planned to improve in the future.
